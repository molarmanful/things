# Divination

I decided to use a digital variation of **dictiomancy**, divination based on opening a dictionary to random pages. Through my digital dictiomancy, I divined ten words:

```
magazine
business
undress
account
instinct
suspicion
perception
have
structure
scenario
```

From here, I decided to use the "magic" of AI to create the artwork. I first used ChatGPT to generate some text.

*make a poem with the following words: magazine business undress account instinct suspicion perception have structure scenario*

```
A magazine for business, with advice to undress,
An account of how to follow your instinct with finesse,
A sense of suspicion that may alter your perception,
A structure to build and scenarios to mention.

With words and tips to help you grow,
The magazine presents a way to go,
From a life of mediocrity to one that's bright,
By tapping into your instincts and following your sight.

The scenarios may change, and the winds may shift,
But the foundation remains, and the structure still lifts,
Your perception of the world, and all that lies ahead,
With the knowledge and tools, success is guaranteed.

So heed the words, and trust in your gut,
For the magazine and business will show you what's what,
With a clear perception and a solid structure in place,
Success is yours, and it's just a matter of grace.

*make a story with those words*

> Once upon a time, there was a young man named Jack who worked at a local business. Despite his hard work, he felt unfulfilled and was searching for something more. One day, while browsing the shelves at the bookstore, he stumbled upon a magazine that caught his eye. It was called "The Magazine for Business Success".
>
> Intrigued, Jack purchased the magazine and began reading it on his commute home. The first article he read was about how to undress your limitations and tap into your instinct to make the right decisions. Jack was fascinated by the idea and started implementing the tips in his own life.
>
> At work, Jack's coworkers noticed a change in him. He was more confident and decisive, and his boss took notice as well. Jack was promoted to a higher position and was given more responsibility. Despite this new challenge, Jack's newfound sense of instinct and perception gave him the confidence he needed to succeed.
>
> However, not everyone was happy with Jack's sudden rise to success. One of his coworkers, Sarah, had a suspicion that Jack was up to something. She tried to bring up her concerns with the boss, but Jack's solid structure and clear perception made him seem untouchable. Sarah's suspicions were unfounded, and she eventually left the company in frustration.
>
> As for Jack, he continued to thrive in his new role and eventually became a successful business leader. He never forgot the lessons he learned from the magazine and was grateful for the impact it had on his life. From that day on, he made sure to always have a copy of "The Magazine for Business Success" by his side, ready to face any scenario that came his way.
