A fork that Shake Shack includes with cheese fries, meant to keep hands from getting dirty when eating the fries.

## Issues

- Prongs are too blunt, preventing people from being able to stab the fries
- Prongs are too shallow/wide proportionally; acts as a knife that cuts softer fries instead of stabbing them.
- Poor QA; inconsistent production worsens prong issues.

The purpose that this fork serves is a valid one, but its prong design fails to take advantage of its thinness to serve as an effective alternative to a regular fork.

## Solution(s)

Obvious solutions:

- Use a fork. More prongs and better construction/sharpness/ergonomics (usually) for ability to pick up multiple fries simultaneously.
- Use a toothpick. Simple, thin design makes it effortless to pick out individual fries.
- Use chopsticks. Combines benefits of fork and toothpick at cost of dexterity requirement.

Proper solution:

Looking at other existing 2-pronged wooden forks, the better forks have deeper cuts and sharper tips.

- 2 prongs: simply deepen the gap between the 2 prongs, preventing "knife" effect and also allowing for certain fries to be "grabbed" like chopsticks.
- 1 prong: inspired by the toothpick, but better for piercing crunchier fries. Has "hilt" to prevent overpenetration.
