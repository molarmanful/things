# Reflection

Before I took this class (and started the food journal), I often had rather
loose eating habits. I'd generally eat what I wanted to eat, and trusted that
e.g. if I ate unhealthily for a few days, I would get tired of eating unhealthy
foods and would switch to healthy foods for the next few days. Alongside this
was my "reliance" (?) on exercise/being active to allow me to have a more
leeway in eating how I wanted. Here in NYC, eating wasn't really an emotional
thing; after all, I was in a city I didn't like, away from home and the food I
liked in California. I usually bought groceries, ate out, or bought take-out as
a matter of convenience rather than any deeper health choices.

After starting the food journal and taking the class, I began thinking much
more consciously about how I approached food. At the supermarket, I would pay
more attention to nutritional facts/ingredients. I thought more about why I ate
the way I ate. Over time, these began affecting my eating behaviors. For
example, I would make certain buying choices and decisions based on what I had
learned in class about the "Dirty Dozen."

I would also pay more attention to how I felt while getting food. A few months
ago, a Wegman's supermarket opened near where I lived, and I decided to get
groceries from there to see what they had. I didn't like the experience, to say
the least. The supermarket was split into two floors, a ground floor and a
basement. The ground floor had premade foods like sushi and sandwiches. To get
to the ingredients or the "real" groceries, I had to descend an escalator into
the basement. Just this alone was jarring; I'm used to:

1. Supermarkets back home spread out laterally, with one floor only. (I suppose
   that the fact that the lack of space in NYC makes it necessary for
   supermarkets to have a basement floor.)
1. Supermarkets place fresh produce at the entrance.
1. Supermarkets have a cashier/someone to check you out. Wegman's had
   self-checkout only.

The idea of having to go into a basement to get food, then coming back up to
check out the food myself made the whole experience feel impersonal/inhuman.
The place was also extremely crowded, but this did nothing to make the
experience feel more human in any way; if anything, it just made the experience
even more unpleasant.

As such, I continue to buy my groceries at H-Mart, which, unlike Wegmans:

1. Has only one floor.
1. Places fresh produce at the entrance.
1. Has friendly cashiers to help me bag my groceries properly.
1. Perhaps most importantly, has a selection that fits my preference for Asian
   food.
