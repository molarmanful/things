# Week 3

## [*Dreamspace*](http://www.dream-space.net)

I tried the experiences made by Nadav Assor, Mark Dorf, Alexander Porter, and Yefeng Wang. I found the premise of modeling a space based on a dream to be quite interesting, especially the specific instruction to leave unrecalled parts of the dream spaces blank. Initially - that is, going in blind without knowing the premise - I felt a bit underwhelmed by the spaces since they felt empty and perhaps even unfinished. But after reading the *Dreamspace* description/statement, I replayed each of the experiences with a fresh perspective and found the pieces to be far more interesting, albeit still rough-looking (in my opinion of course). Oftentimes, we tend to approach 3D rendering from a rather reality-centric mindset where "good" 3D renders are closer to reality than not. As such, I found *Dreamspace*'s acknowledgement of the "impossibility of technological reconstruction" intriguing.
